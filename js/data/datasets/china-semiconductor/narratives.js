    text: 'SMIC achieves 5nm chip production using DUV lithography workaround',
    description: 'Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) has reportedly achieved 5nm chip production despite lacking access to ASML\'s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Industry analysts confirm SMIC is using multi-patterning techniques with older deep ultraviolet (DUV) equipment, though at significantly lower yields and higher costs than competitors. The breakthrough raises questions about the effectiveness of export controls and demonstrates Chinese determination to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency.',

    description: 'The Biden administration has pressured the Netherlands to expand export controls on ASML, now blocking shipments of not just EUV but also advanced DUV lithography systems to China. ASML reported the restrictions will reduce their China revenue by $2.5 billion annually. The Dutch government acquiesced after months of negotiations, with Chinese officials condemning the move as "technological hegemony." Industry analysts warn the restrictions may accelerate Chinese efforts to develop indigenous lithography equipment.',
