    text: 'Self-checkout frustrations spark viral complaints about theft accusations and customer treatment',
    description: 'A wave of customer complaints has gone viral on social media after multiple incidents where Walmart customers were stopped, searched, or accused of theft at self-checkout stations. Videos show confrontations between customers and loss prevention staff, with many customers claiming they were humiliated despite having receipts. The controversy intensified after a class-action lawsuit was filed in Texas alleging systematic false detention of customers. Walmart has defended its loss prevention practices while announcing plans to add more staffed checkout lanes in select stores.',

    description: 'Customers across multiple states are reporting persistent empty shelves and out-of-stock items at Walmart stores, particularly in grocery and household essentials. Social media posts show bare aisles, with some customers driving to multiple locations without finding needed products. Walmart has attributed the issues to supply chain disruptions and regional distribution challenges, but retail analysts note the company\'s inventory management system may need significant upgrades.

    description: 'Social media discussions and consumer surveys indicate growing perception that Walmart\'s prices are no longer significantly lower than competitors. Analysis shows Walmart retained pandemic-era price increases on many items even as wholesale costs declined. The narrative has intensified after viral TikTok videos showed price comparisons between Walmart, Aldi, and Amazon showing Walmart losing on several staple items. Retail analysts note this threatens Walmart\'s core brand promise of "Everyday Low Prices."',

Walmart\'s delivery service has faced criticism for delays, substitutions, and quality issues with grocery items. Consumer sentiment surveys show a 12-point swing toward competitors for online grocery orders. Walmart has announced a $1.5 billion investment in delivery infrastructure, but analysts question if it\'s enough to close the gap.',
